    <p>The Strymon Blue Sky Reverberator is a reverb effect pedal with way more features than just about any other Reverb pedal. It gives you amazing control over the size and tone of your reverb, and even pre-delay: an important control left out by most reverb pedals. The Blue Sky also has stereo input and outputs so you can use it with other stereo effects to create huge lush tones! Stymon are some of the most sought after and best loved guitar pedals in the world. The tones are incredible and there are few pedals that match up head to head on tone or features!</p>

    <span class="desc-title">Why this is great</span>
    <p>The philosophy behind the blueSky Reverberator is simple—take a ridiculously powerful SHARC DSP and dedicate it to doing one thing only: producing the most lush, majestic and stunning reverbs ever. Many hours and sleepless nights in the Strymon sound design labs were devoted to developing the complex reverb algorithms found inside blueSky. We squeezed every last drop of processing power available.</p>

<p>Whether you're a classic spring reverb fan or a studio rack aficionado, you'll find your mojo here. blueSky provides three different reverb types, each with three modes, for a total of nine completely unique reverb experiences. blueSky even delivers an extremely versatile plate reverb, a rarity for a stompbox pedal. A full pre-delay and damping section provide deep reverb tone shaping. Add the mod and shimmer modes and you're in store for unending reverb bliss. Couple that with 24-bit 96kHz converters and 115dB typical signal to noise, blueSky is equally at home on top of a studio console as it is in front of a tube amp.</p>
