    <p>Essentially, it's a tremolo and reverb in one pedal. The tremolo side is just about the most dynamic tremolo ever. The reverb side is a spring, perfectly built for slow leads.</p>

    <span class="desc-title">SOULFUL SYNERGY</span>
<p>The VHT Melo-Verb is a pedal recreation of the fabled tremolo and reverb effects that were first introduced as built-in amplifier features in the â60s. The two effects sections are completely independent, with separate true-bypass switching.</p>

<span class="desc-title">TREMOLO</span>
<p>The all-analog Tremolo section features classic Speed and Intensity controls, and for additional flexibility, it also has modern Shape and Level controls. The Shape control adjusts the tremolo character - everything from retro floating undulations to modern square-cornered chop. When the Tremolo is engaged, the Level control can be set for added boost to help the effect stand-out more in the mix. With the Depth control turned down, the Tremolo section can also serve as a clean boost pedal, with up to 9dB of boost from the Level control - it's like getting a clean boost pedal for free.</p>

<span class="desc-title">REVERB</span>
<p>The Reverb section replicates the classic built-in tube-driven spring reverb tone, and takes it one step further with the addition of Tone and Mix controls, which were found on the most coveted outboard â60s reverb units. The reverb tones range from soft, warm and round to bright splashy "tile wall spatter."</p>


<p>Separately, these two effects provide a wide range of classic and modern tones - together they're an unbeatable value.</p>
