			    <h2>Welcome to Clue!</h2>
			    <p>This game is murder</p>
			    
			    <p>It is a dark and stormy night at Tudor Mansion.  While enjoying a nice game of hide and seek with some of your buddy, John Boddy's friends, the power goes out. When the lights come back on, everyone reconvenes, only John isn't around.  Everyone moves to the hallway and....John has been murdered and his body's been moved!!!! You give the shifty eye to everyone there. Someone (maybe even you) is hiding something. Not wanting to be the next victim and not trusting one another, you all spread out in search of clues.  Who did it? Where? And with what? Find out or you may be next!</p>

			    <h2>Make A Suggestion</h2>
			    <p>Put out a theory on who done it</p>
			    <div id="suggestion">
			    	<p>Here is where you make a suggestion.  Your choices will be dependent on the cards that you currently have or have seen.  The room of choice will always be the room you are in.  If you would like to choose a different room, you will have to travel to that room. Once a suggestion has been made, the next player will check the cards that they have.  If they have one of the cards that you suggest, it will be shown to you and your checklist will be updated. Once you have been shown a card, no other players have do disprove your suggestion.  If the next player doesn't have a card, your suggestion passes to next player and so on. You will be required to choose a card to show to your opposition when they make a suggestion, should your turn be next or the player before you has none of the cards.  If you choose to make a suggestion or accusation in the future, the choices you have remaining will be reflected.  Any cards shown to you will show up in your checklist as orange.  Use suggestions to narrow down the potential suspects to figure out who was murdered.  Remember though, there are others trying to solve the murder as well.  Be smart, cunning and fast.</p>

			    <p></p>
			    <p>I built this game using solely some custom CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery. I decided to build Clue because I'm a bit nostalgic, but also because it required a lot of logic that I wanted to work through.  It has been an awesome challenge and I hope you enjoy it!</p>
			    <p>The patterns used on the background, paper, and leather are modified from <a href='http://subtlepatterns.com'/>Subtle Patterns</a>. The notepad is based on a theme from <a href='http://megandalbey.com'>http://megandalbey.com</a>. The flashlight is based on a theme from <a href='http://codepen.io/pa7/'>http://Patrick Wied</a>. Other than that, the rest is mine.  If you like my game, feel free to view more of my work at <a href='http://forlorne.us'>http://forlorne.us</a></p>
