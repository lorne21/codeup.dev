	// roll dice x
	// track player squares moved x
	// gamelog update x
		// make log functions and styles
		// 	one for player turn
		// 	one for player die roll x
		// 	one for player enter room x
		// 	one for player use secret passage
		// 	one for player suggestion
		// 	one for player accusation
	// store dice value in movesAllowed x 
	// if movesAllowed > 0....
		// must run a check
			// if player is in hallway, turn ends, squares moved = 0
			// if player enters door, moves = 0, inroom class
				//if squares moved > 0, run inRoom function
			// if player is inRoom and wants to leave
				// create function to determine doors if multiple
				// ask what door to leave
				// move active player to that door
				// roll dice
	//if player is inRoom to start turn
		//ask if they want to leave
		//if there's a secret door and they have said door in array, ask if they 
		// want to use
			// if yes, re-run inRoom function at new location

// 1. randomly decide who goes first
		// - load players onto start buttons
// 2. if turn = activeplayer then run playerturn
// 3. if player not inRoom, load button to roll dice, remove button. else,
	// load button to use secret passage if exists, begin room functionality
// 4. if dice, moves allowed = dice total
// 5. move character one space per move
// 6. if player is still in hallway, load button to end turn
// 7. if player enters a door, moves = 0, begin room functionality
// 8. if inRoom: 
	// a) load buttons to make suggestion, make accusation, end turn

// 9. Suggestion: 
	// a) select weapon, room will be inRoom class, select character
	// b) on submit, for each player, if they have one or more of the cards
	// pick random card and show to active player
	// c) push new card into card array and update detective notebook
			// -cpu will need its own array for a checklist. need to make function for it
	// d) at beginning, remove suggestion button

// 10. Accusation:
	// a) select weapon, room, character
	// b) on submit, check if accArray == winArray
	// c) if right, game win. wrong, game lose
	// d) load new game button

// Challenging Part
// 1. Making logic for computer move
// 2. pick room
// 3. get door (if more than one get closest)
// 4. determine if it's less moves to go horizontal or vertical
