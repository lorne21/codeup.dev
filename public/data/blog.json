        "content": "So once upon a time there was a boy. This boy was just entering the second grade and already was tall for his class. Being the early 90s and also in elementary school, it is safe to say that his fashion sense was sub-par as was demonstrated by the purple sweats and 'hang loose' t-shirt he was wearing. After school one day, he was chillin in the playground, contemplating going on the monkey bars. He was, you see, in one of those after school day care type situations where the kid has to figure out what to do for 4 hours while he waits for his parents to pick him up. So, being bored, he decides to take to the monkey bars. He's swinging there, confident that no one else in the second grade is nearly as good on those bars as he is (he was however at this point, alone, and thus there was no witness to actually appreciate his prowess at the art of the monkey). Suddenly, two fellow classmates appeared. One by the name of Mark, the other Seandan. They, being the trouble makers that they were, ran up to the boy on the monkey bars (who stopped swinging upon viewing them), pulled down those purple sweats that the boy was wearing, and ran. The poor boy, transformers underwear exposed to the world, hung there in shock, this being the first time he was ever pantsed, and not knowing how to handle the situation, hung from the monkey bars and started to cry. Now the two trouble makers re-enter the scene shocked to still find the boy hanging on the monkey bars with his pants down, wondering why he hadn't dropped down and pulled up his pants. Perhaps it was the shock, perhaps deep down, the boy felt, that whatever it was, him hanging there was proof that an injustice had been done and whomever came around would perhaps be able to ascertain the situation and punish those responsible...basically, don't mess up the crime scene. The two, decided then and there to make a second run, this time to go for the glory pants and get the underwear as well. This time the boy was prepared, as they approached, the boy started swing his legs around violently, assured that this if anything would win the battle (he was the best monkey bar swinger in town). Crying the whole while the two, not wanting to get clipped by the boy's legs, decided that the fun was over and ran back away. Upon hearing the crying, one teacher finally noticed this poor boy hanging from the monkey bars. She was equally shocked that the boy hadn't just dropped down but having the sympathy to understand that this might be his first pantsing, advised him to drop down and pull up his pants. The boy did so, feeling immediately better, and not to mention warmer. As for justice, turns out Mark and Seandan lived a block away from the school and turned hightail and ran home. In other words, none was done. A scar, but a funny one, was left. A true story for all to learn from. If pantsed, pull up your pants.",

        "title": "Second Grade Crush",
        "content": "Now second grade was a dangerous time for a young boy. It was a time of intrigue and discovery, and of both, this boy had realized cooties. Up until this point it was a well known fact that girls had cooties however he had never realized how such a simple thing as a touch or even deadlier, a kiss could transmit eternal shame to a young boy. And yet, the intrigue of something so forbidden was of course always very apparent. Now, as in most things in life, people generally fall into a certain phase at a certain age. They don't have to be told about it, or how to do it, or what the traits are...it's instinctual and people just pick it up naturally. Girls in second grade pick up the idea of kissing boys during recess in a game commonly referred to as 'kissy girls'. Granted, this is a pretty lame name, but this author attributes it to lack of a vocabulary during this period of time. No second grader is quite aware of the nuances of other terms to use them to describe the actual title of the event taking place. So the idea of young women, who we call 'girls' and embracing via the lips, which we call 'kissing' came together in a magnificent stroke of genius by some second grader in phase we call 'kissy girls'. And so it was, that every recess, the boy and his friends would spend the 15 minute recess, running away from kiss-starved girls who would chase them down and plant one on them if they got the chance. This boy, as mentioned earlier, was tall for his age and also, quite fast, easily the fastest in his class. This may sound like a biased bragging but the authors sees no fault in stating fact. Praised by the other boys for not contracting the 'cootie' disease, the boy also realized that he was becoming a minority in the sense that it seemed everyone was getting 'cooties' and living on and he was the only one left out. The others said that it was better not to have it, but what did that mean? Was it another trick? Reverse psychology perhaps? The boy was determined to find out for himself. And for you sick people, don't let your mind wander to wherever, this story is innocent. Kyla. Well, in the second grade class, there happened to be a girl named Caitlin. Of all the girls, she was just about as tall as the boy and thus earned both his respect and his admiration. She was also however, a known kissy girl and as such, the enemy. The two tore at each other, pleasure derived from the pain, and the boy needed an out. Parents were a definite no. No friends would really understand his plight. Luckily, the teacher had provided one. A journal, a simple entry with which the boy could release his innermost thoughts. The boy wrote down about the kissy girls, he wrote about the cooties, but mostly he wrote about Caitlin and his secret desire that she would one day catch him and lay a big fat one on his cheek. The journal solved everything, freeing the boy from the pressure and he resumed his daily life. Still being the only one without cooties, and proud of it. As usual, all good things come to an end, and this happiness was fairly short lived. See, what the teacher failed to mention, was that the journal entries were public, probably thinking that second graders wouldn't write anything too serious or personal. So the following day in class, she decided to read a select few of the students journals out loud to the class. Go figure. So where was the boy's? Safe to say that it was in the pile? Yes. And it was. The boy's thoughts were broadcast to the entirety of the second grade class and all he could do was sit, as he listened to the progression of this thoughts to the climax of the entry: the mention of Caitlin and the kiss that he so secretly desired. The series of 'oooooooooo's' and giggles that ensued were long enough to watch a snail cross the street. The respect of being without cooties lost, the speed no longer mattered, the fingers pointed all to reveal, he who would be kissed. But never was. At least not until later. But that's another story. And remember, never trust a teacher, and keep your journal hidden.",
